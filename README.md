# Ibind
This repository provides a tools for p-values (dependent) combination.
There are two versions of Ibind. 

# 1. Combine p-values in two dimension 
This script allows you to combine two p-value by using 3 methods, Ibind, Fisher's, and decorrelation methods.
In addition, Ibind is allowed an advanced option to use. You can change the weight between two p-values. (More precisely, it changes the statistics <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?p_{1}p_{2}" title="p_{1}p_{2}" /> to <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?p_{1}^{w}p_{2}^{(1-w)}" title="p_{1}^{w}p_{2}^{(1-w)}" />.)

# 2. Combine p-values in higher dimension
This script only allows you to combind n p-value by using Ibind method.
